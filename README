The API has two available requests:
First, a request to see if there is a content update. The request looks like: http://osb.techyeti.com/checkforupdates.php?key=1f6a584bed23f31311a0c74cd1887382
where the api_key is generated from: $api_key = md5(md5('This is a super top secret string!').md5(gmdate('m/d/y h'))); for a little security. Note: the api key is only valid for an hour.
The error JSON response will look like {"isError":1,"code":500,"message":"invalid API key","size":0} and the success response looks like {"isError":0,"code":1,"message":"An update is available","size":210173}. Notice the success response informs the app that an update is available and provides the filesize in bytes.

The second request is something like: http://osb.techyeti.com/downloadupdate.php?key=1f6a584bed23f31311a0c74cd1887382. If the api key is valid and an update is available, it is made available for download. Currently, you can download the default hpub that comes with the baker project.

The above URLs do work and for testing from your browser, you can get the currently active api key here: http://osb.techyeti.com/getkey.php
